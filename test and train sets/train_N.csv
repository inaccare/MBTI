I hope not :) are you? :/ I thought you were ENFP once but since you have struck me as ENFJ :) also I notice your ENFJ avatar! I love that she's ENFJ!

Very true! :) They also seem to interact more like ENTJ and ESFP rather than ESTJ and ESFP :)

"I always saw that at her using Se-Ni. She's comfortable with making plans and embarking on the journey it will take to get to that plan, but it is not as though she is content with her routine."
Surely she's an ENTJ? :o
Why? :)

You are so welcome! She's a wonderful actress! :)

I am a massive fan! :) She's not an ENFJ or an INFJ :) She strikes me as an ESTP.
"Alright, I shall check those things out! Thank you :)"
"Thank you so much for replying, no that is not me :) That's Lynda Carter, who is extremely gorgeous I agree :)  I was thinking it could be Fe, sort of overexposure to feelings? or something? :)"

Hi I just want to ask if other INFJs have the guts to dominate or if no chance be submissive to others. In my case Im always on the submissive side as if I have no chance to control myself or others
Darnit baby! I want to show myself to others but cant. I want to show my talents. hahahaha. but too shy to do so. And Im so afraid of getting rejected..
"I dont know what to do. I feel incomplete, I dont feel emotionally connected and I always change every time and then. Im tired being surrounded by these people who dominates me and handling my life...."
Why are we so kind individual? I mean why do we always want to help? I think its because we want to be notice. I want to feel that I belong in this world too. Is that so wrong? Grrr.

I always daydreaming about me. I am a singer in a concert and the crowds are clapping and enjoying their time listening to my voice. They look like they are really having fun :))) ROFL
I always feel that I never did anything good. Darn.
Dont worry guys! Im here for you :)))))
Darn. Its the same with me. People dont really listen! Hate it!
Around people? You mean when we are not around of people we can be free? Or we dont let ourselves to get out of this box Im feeling. We cant be who really are because of people judging us.
Hey everyone! Have you felt that you are inside the box and hiding? I mean Im there and Im around people but why I feel so invisible as if no one really see me.
Mine is : perlasjean
I cry when people keeps saying I did not good enough where as I did give my best. And when they blame me on their own mistakes :(

You INFPs are always self pitying.
Yehey! You agree with me! Yes its nudity but not trying to seduce them.
Yeah I think they should not look.
What? You think its hot? My parents are telling me to put on clothes. But I really dislike it! Do you think its okay to walk around the house nude?

Woah ESTPs vulnerable? Really? You guys have a good body which I really admire. Maybe you are strong outside but vulnerable inside
Are you 594? hehehe. Im 459. Glad to meet you :))
Have you ever experience that people laugh at us so/sx's? uh. I hate it! Im walking doing my own thing and the people around are smiling and laughing.
yeah we should all be put to a fucking death I guess
I find myself talking differently. I mean how I pronounce them.
Why? Do you hate us that much?
Im so/sx. how do you guys see us? are we acting different?
a fucking senseless person.
I do the same thing. Im an escapist! and I really dont want to be on the spotlight.
what a face! LOL
Of course not! you're enneagram type 2. I really have a huge attraction with Enneagram 2 people :D
you said you're a type 2 right? well i've seen some 2s really afraid of people and as I observe them they really are very very awkward.
SX/SO SO/SX SX/SP SP/SX SP/SO SO/SP  and what stacking do you love and hate the most?
Hi fellow ISFPs. Do you find yourself lately difficult to deal with the crowd? :confused:
I really love you guys when it comes to clothing! :d hahahaha!
the main purpose why people live is to find God and have faith in him
We are disappearing and we are not the crowds favorite anymoree :( .
Hahaha! Well yeah you're right. I live in the Philippines. Our country is just copying the culture style of korea. ISFPs here are becoming more rare.

"I need to think this through... but wouldn't that explane the poor internal handling of feelings? So they can't make fast interpretations of things that really needs the Fi, like if someone says I..."
I think that INTP's emotion Fi is so slow to react in the moment and the logic is always slower than emotion so the time is needed.

I totally agree. ENTJs need a lot of shutting off to do.. which is probably why no super heroes are inspired by ENTJ attitudes.  Interestingly there's a lot of ENTJ badass super villains though.......

ENTJs are knowledge appliers...  So we are book smart but probably spend less time reading. We rather apply what we've learnt more

Why do we complain about people generalizing?  Isn't MBTI all about generalizing?  Generalizing = Simplifying
Book smart = No people skills
I am ENTJ... and my fav was physics cause it's applied theory. I guess this has something to do with Te (Applying) and Ni (Theory).
"Which is better, Book Smart or Street Smart?  Which Type tends to be more street smart?  Which Type tends to be more book smart?"

"But common, you guys love hands on work and hate doing paperwork rightg??. You guys prefer to get your hands dirty, whether it be software programming or physical work, you prefer action."
So Ti loves to solve problems. Yeah it does makes sense. ISTPs just love fixing up mechanical stuff... INTPs probably love more complicated stuff

I think INTJs' more developed tertiary Fi works for them as a moral compass and an important decision making tool. It also can make them more artsy/sentimental (think INFPs and enneagram 4s).'

I think he's probably an INFP.
John Mayer - Vultures
Huge fan here. I can relate to a lot of his songs. I admire how confessional his music is and the fact that it has such a unique sound compared to most rap/hip-hop.
I don't really look like any but I've gotten the Smallville guy a few times.
I'm pretty sure my mom was an ENFP.

"If you're so sensitive about your identity, you're Fi, not Fe."
Billie Joe is an INFJ 4.
My intiition is telling me ISFP but I could be wrong.
Nick- INFJ? Juliette- INFJ Monroe- ISFJ? Could be INFP even? Bud- ISFJ? Adalind- ESFP Kelly- ESTJ Angelina- Not ENTP. I don't know about her. That's all I've got for now.

The tertiary function is developed decently enough. The inferior function is used in bursts because it's hard to control. You're either a mistyped ISTJ or you're not adept at analyzing yourself.
Lol. What subjects that aren't taught do you wish were taught?
You sound like a very successful ESTP. Your Ti must've been very well developed.
"Ah, I figured. My ISTJ father never liked subjective things like the Arts either. ENTPs like it more because we're Ne dominant and we like to play around with ideas and be creative."
"Wow, that sucks that they made Philosophy just the history of philosophy. They should've mixed that in with critical thinking, instead of just the history of the subject."
"Thay, how do you know what your functions are? Did you take a test online? Those aren't always accurate. You need to read Jung's books on the functions and figure yourself out that way."

You sound like an INTP instead of INTJ. Ti is critical thinking. Te is all about facts.

Fascinating. Are there any subjects you wish were taught in school but aren't?
"That does make sense. I certainly see the correlation there. What else do you think would develop Ni, as well as Fe and Ti?"

"Psychology was definitely interesting. I liked bio somewhat. If school was perfect in your opinion, what would it be like? What subjects that aren't already taught would you want to be taught?"
I really liked Literature too. Are there any subjects you wish were taught in school but aren't?

I'm an ENTP and I'd like to see how the interests of my shadow personality compare to the interests of ENTPs. We might have a lot in common since we have the same functions.
I'd like to compare the interests of ENTPs to that of ESFJs... I think we might actually have a lot in common due to having the same functions.

I'm curious to see how the typical interests of ISTPs in high school compare to the interests many ENTPs had in high school. Do a lot of you like Math due to being Ti dom?

What subjects did you guys like in high school? I'm an ENTP and I liked the majority of subjects. Did you like less because you use Ni instead of Ne?
I'd like to know how my interests in school as an ENTP compare and contrast with the interests of ENTJs in school.
I'm an ENTP and I'm curious to see how my interests in high school were different than what INTJs like. I'm sure we're both generally interested in Science. What about Language Arts? Do you guys like...

Yeah essentially! ENFPs tend to be the most 'Introverted of the Extroverts' so a lot of the time they tend to get mistaken to be INFPs a lot!
"Okay, going by that comment and the other comments on this thread, I think I'm going to have to also agree for the moment and type him as a ESFP!"

Thanks for your opinion but this is directed to those who came to the conclusion they are INFP and why they think they are.
