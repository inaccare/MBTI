They could always tell me... would it be okay to discriminate then? And either way I must digress... how do you know who was born into a political community and who joined after reaching adulthood?
Distinction for what? If it's only bad to discriminate when it has to do with factors that a person is born into then by definition that would exclude religious converts.
Great. So according to this it would be okay to discriminate against religious converts... after all it was their choice to convert and their choice to accept those beliefs.

So apparently I shouldn't have nearly as good a relationship with my INFP roommate as I do. Hmm. :dry:
Watching Reba and about to fix a bowl of ice cream. :laughing:

I do get elated when I feel like I can trust people.  I get a lot of enjoyment out of being able to trust someone and I idealize them a lot if I like them.  I have a funny story:  I told the entj I...

"That makes more sense.  Don't want any pressure for a relationship unless it's for sure, for sure, for sure.  Pressure for having a relationship does sneak up on me and I don't know what to do."
I don't really relate to wanting to date ten people.  It's just that a person will have to be worth all my obsessive thinking and worrying otherwise it's better to just avoid relationships...
I think I read that isfp's usually go about never thinking about relationship's and then when they do it is the only thing they can think about.  This is true for me.  It is hard to not get obsessive...
