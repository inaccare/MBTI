Any more opinions? :o
"No, I understand :) I was just wondering what made it different so we could maybe decide.  In terms of those types, I highly doubt she posesses Fi, and that she is not an Se dominant :)"
It's not off base :) Thank you very much!
"ENFP and INFP are the same functions but in different orders.  In terms of if Belle is an extrovert or an introvert, her being extremely unhappy with the life that she lives in the town, and wanting..."
"Right, but why? :)"
Very true! :) They also seem to interact more like ENTJ and ESFP rather than ESTJ and ESFP :)
"Ni tends to take a lot of things and bring them together into fully fledged ideas.. I always thought Tiana's view for her resturant was very Ni, but I could also be wrong, I also think Naveen is..."
"Not at all? She was always looking towards the future and using what was happening around her in order to propel herself towards the future she wished to achieve, of course her father was the guiding..."
"I always saw that at her using Se-Ni. She's comfortable with making plans and embarking on the journey it will take to get to that plan, but it is not as though she is content with her routine."
Surely she's an ENTJ? :o
Why? :)
"Oh well, you surely deserve to feel very proud of yourself :) You are an amazing human being, I really hope you're having an okay time :)"
You are so welcome! She's a wonderful actress! :)

"Gatsby, surely operates on Fe? And lacks Ti?"
I'd say she was an ESFJ. :)

Isn't he an ESFJ? :)

"I think you absolutely nailed it on the head. :) His whole 'I shall make jokes, because they're funny to me' is just so ENFP."
Why not?
I am a massive fan! :) She's not an ENFJ or an INFJ :) She strikes me as an ESTP.
"Alright, I shall check those things out! Thank you :)"
"Thank you so much for replying, no that is not me :) That's Lynda Carter, who is extremely gorgeous I agree :)  I was thinking it could be Fe, sort of overexposure to feelings? or something? :)"

Sorry :) I was trying to illustrate that we could take the things she said at face value.. :/

Wanted traits  - non judgemental/understanding - smart  - modest  - independent  - logical   Turn off traits  - insecurity  - immature jealousy
"She's 21. Let's just say she's not as emotionally or mentally mature as some would expect 20-something year olds. But I have faith in her, she'll get there some day."
"As an Fe user, I understand Fi and sympathize with it but I don't necessarily agree with it. I find it annoying when people put their emotions first or are insensitive towards other peoples emotions..."
I never saw it as daddy issues. I always saw it as her being too nice but with a hidden agenda.

wow doesn't sound like a very healthy INFJ.
Isn't angelina an introvert too? Maybe it's because jennifer was an SJ lol
I haven't thought about it much but I'd say ENTP

I think derek is ISTP.   I've just started watching teen wolf but is derek supposed to be such an asshole? The way he treats basically everyone on the show is pretty shitty...
Dear istp   Thanks for being the only person in the world who indulges in the same activity as me: doing dumb shit   Sincerely infj
Its the other way around. ISTP is supposedly ISTj in socionics. So your dual is the ENFj. The last letter only changes only for introverts
IxFP 4w3

Carmelo Anthony seems pretty introverted to me and Russell Westbrook is not an ISTP.

Hi I just want to ask if other INFJs have the guts to dominate or if no chance be submissive to others. In my case Im always on the submissive side as if I have no chance to control myself or others
Darnit baby! I want to show myself to others but cant. I want to show my talents. hahahaha. but too shy to do so. And Im so afraid of getting rejected..
"I dont know what to do. I feel incomplete, I dont feel emotionally connected and I always change every time and then. Im tired being surrounded by these people who dominates me and handling my life...."
Why are we so kind individual? I mean why do we always want to help? I think its because we want to be notice. I want to feel that I belong in this world too. Is that so wrong? Grrr.

I always feel that I never did anything good. Darn.
Dont worry guys! Im here for you :)))))
Darn. Its the same with me. People dont really listen! Hate it!
Around people? You mean when we are not around of people we can be free? Or we dont let ourselves to get out of this box Im feeling. We cant be who really are because of people judging us.
Hey everyone! Have you felt that you are inside the box and hiding? I mean Im there and Im around people but why I feel so invisible as if no one really see me.

Yeah I think they should not look.

Woah ESTPs vulnerable? Really? You guys have a good body which I really admire. Maybe you are strong outside but vulnerable inside
Are you 594? hehehe. Im 459. Glad to meet you :))
Have you ever experience that people laugh at us so/sx's? uh. I hate it! Im walking doing my own thing and the people around are smiling and laughing.
yeah we should all be put to a fucking death I guess
I find myself talking differently. I mean how I pronounce them.
Why? Do you hate us that much?
Im so/sx. how do you guys see us? are we acting different?
a fucking senseless person.
I do the same thing. Im an escapist! and I really dont want to be on the spotlight.
what a face! LOL
Of course not! you're enneagram type 2. I really have a huge attraction with Enneagram 2 people :D
you said you're a type 2 right? well i've seen some 2s really afraid of people and as I observe them they really are very very awkward.
SX/SO SO/SX SX/SP SP/SX SP/SO SO/SP  and what stacking do you love and hate the most?
Hi fellow ISFPs. Do you find yourself lately difficult to deal with the crowd? :confused:
I really love you guys when it comes to clothing! :d hahahaha!
the main purpose why people live is to find God and have faith in him
We are disappearing and we are not the crowds favorite anymoree :( .
Hahaha! Well yeah you're right. I live in the Philippines. Our country is just copying the culture style of korea. ISFPs here are becoming more rare.

I think that INTP's emotion Fi is so slow to react in the moment and the logic is always slower than emotion so the time is needed.

Great story.  I've always thought programming was more of an INTP domain.  How strong is the T in you i.e. are you mildly F?
"Not to sound rude or anything, I just can't comprehend myself how an ISFJ can like programming. Maybe it's the Fe side of programming? like designing GUI, delivering client's expectation and etc......"

":sad:  Yeah, I think ENTJ too. Cause we have Se as our third function."
What do you mean by realistic?
"When you are studying for an Exam, you can't concentrate when there are small background noises!"
"LOL!, that just cracked me up ... !!"
"If you're hanging around in forums like these, I think you're not much of mainstream anymore :)"
"I read somewhere that when a person is stressed out he will resort to his third and forth function; the function he normally ignores. So an ENTJ will become ISFP, and INFP will become ESTJ....etc......"
Hmm... I've alway thought it's an E vs I thing  E when stressed go into seclusion I when stressed find people  Seems not true....

First of all thanks for starting this thread. I'm a Muslim and I've just red this thread from the beginning. The way I see it is that burning the Quran is an act to ignite muslim anger. We respect...
"I think to be a successful ENTJ or leader, one needs to develop all functions....  including Fi and Fe."
That's a simplification. We need to see things from other people's point of views. ENTJs make tonnes of mistakes. We always think it makes sense to us but it actually doesn't to the vast majority
"After traversing this forum for months, I've learned that ESFJs are the kind of people which ENTJs think are too concerned over the small things on other people.   Imagine if you are both going to..."
I totally agree. ENTJs need a lot of shutting off to do.. which is probably why no super heroes are inspired by ENTJ attitudes.  Interestingly there's a lot of ENTJ badass super villains though.......
"Come on man.. I'm an ENTJ... and I don't think ENTJ's are badass  Name me ONE, just ONE, cartoon or movie heroes which is an ENTJ..."
ENTJs are knowledge appliers...  So we are book smart but probably spend less time reading. We rather apply what we've learnt more
OKay I'm rephrasing  Se users = Street Smart  Does this make sense?
"Haha, just trying"
Sensors = Street Smart  Intuitives = Book Smart
"I had 2 ENTP friends who never studied at all, but always get straight A's. They don't get near perfect score but usually it's good enough to get all As....  I've come up with this theory that they..."
This is the meaning of book smart..... http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTvFQhsFseWBfvGoB692ibwYvETiF6HvDy8DGR3B_hqghcgIWE&t=1&usg=__aJd21dD9Ds7Xie022Hy3f5WVAu4=
Why do we complain about people generalizing?  Isn't MBTI all about generalizing?  Generalizing = Simplifying
Book smart = No people skills
I am ENTJ... and my fav was physics cause it's applied theory. I guess this has something to do with Te (Applying) and Ni (Theory).
"Which is better, Book Smart or Street Smart?  Which Type tends to be more street smart?  Which Type tends to be more book smart?"
"Yeah, I agree TJ are the most formal.  I would rank   1) ISTJ 2) ESTJ 3) INTJ 4) ENTJ"
"Well Said!  I can see your style of leadership is more towards inspiring people. You try to bring out the best in people  J's like myself, we like to manage. We like making plans and seeing them..."
"Since none of you guys think that Muslims are behind 9/11,  Why is it that you guys hate muslims so much?? + labelling muslims are terrorist??"
May I know what you do for a living and do you enjoy managing?  Most Ps I know hate doing management. They prefer to blend in and just  be a good bloke
"But common, you guys love hands on work and hate doing paperwork rightg??. You guys prefer to get your hands dirty, whether it be software programming or physical work, you prefer action."
So Ti loves to solve problems. Yeah it does makes sense. ISTPs just love fixing up mechanical stuff... INTPs probably love more complicated stuff
"Yeah, possibly. But still, even if the towers did not collapse they would've attacked Afghanistan anyway.  Engineering facts and simulation do prove the controlled demolition theory. There was even..."
What I don't understand is that if it was a controlled demolition.... why do they want the tower to collapse? They can just leave the plane dangling there..... No need to collapse the entire tower to...
"Nice Post,  I think Intuitives tend to generalize things more, so that's probably why you suspect they tend to be more racist. These are negative intuitors. However, positive intuitors can also see..."
"I have this nice analogy on Ne vs Ni  Imagine you are at a lunch buffet . There's lots of food!   With Ni, you hold on to your plate and take the best food from each serving. You be picky.  With..."
So how do you stimulate your Ti?
"I just read another thread. This guy says that a way to motivate P's is to stimulate their main functions,  Ne = Change their tasks often Se = Give hands on work Fi = Give appreciation Ti = ......."
"Good ideas. So basically it's about motivating and stimulating Ne and Se.  From what i've read,  To motivate Ne = give them new tasks What about motivating Se ?'"

"Oh come on, personality types are neither species or race. It has no actual relation with physical quality."
Gender: male Age: 26-36 Intelligence: gifted Openness: conservative MBTI personality profile: INTJ Closest alternative we found: ENTJ   I really can't think of myself to be a conservative.
"Out of curiousity, what do you think about ENTJs? Do we appear like your alter ego?"
"Well, if i being an ENTJ is a ticket to be perfect i would make it become my professional job and make sure i get paid at least $6000 for every second in my life."
"That actually depends on the person herself. But regarding to types and based on my personal experience and taste, i'd prefer an ESTJ or INTJ woman. I prefer my spouse to be tough, logical,..."

"Hell, i'm in my 20s and i do feel exactly the same thing. In my specific case, i think it's due to too much testosterone. Well, as i don't know you personally, all i can say to you is just to face it..."
Well that's probably because his Ni is inferior since Ni is a powerful and strong function. That's just a possibility though as i don't know your husband well enough to mention the functions he use...
Degree : Professional Hell-raising MBTI : ENTJ  I certainly love it.
"That's right.  I rely on my memory about this one. It's been long since the last time i watch/read Batman. Well, i think he's a Se-dom since he seem to be very cautious with his surrounding that he..."

I'm an ENTJ. Most people in my life thought i'm an ESTP. Mostly because i'm a rebellious heavy-hitting hedonistic rockstar with high testosterone and outrageous sexual activities. Plus the fact that...
"No, i do not. I prefer an organized style in my approach to life rather than an adaptable one. I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me."
"That's a good prove regarding his sensitivity. He seem to feel offended by Jeb.  Talks about your point that it makes more sense that he's an ESFP playing an ENTJ, it's a good point. But he's a..."
ESFP  Type most likely to date with me. I don't know why. For all my life most girls i've date and have a long-term relationship with are ESFPs.
"I used to think he's an ESFP. But i don't think an ESFP could stand to be as much ridiculed as he is. As far as i know, an ESFP tend to try to get rid of the bad image he received. Trump does not..."
The problem is not specifically in ESFJ's stereotype but in the biased stereotype of intelligence and stupidity rather than in the varieties of human abilities themselves. Many people still even...

That's how you think about it but that's not how it's been truly said. I've said earlier that it was an example of both an ISFJ and INFP based with two people of the type and not an entire...

"well, normally i rather get female 6s from behind than vice versa. but that's not what you mean. i know."

"yeah, one gut type bear ( not your ex though) even typed you as 9.."

Hell no. I think we're one of the most direct personality types. I find it really difficult to not voice how I feel. I also find it very difficult to omit/hide things.

think of it as seem building. it needs to be let out or we will explode. do all of those listen. Propose solutions to the problems. give her a solder to cry on.
we run on emotions. so if we are vary pissed we may just have little reasoning and a lot of  emotions to let out.

I love how it's pretty much unanimous that Kenneth is ExFJ. :D The prospect of sharing my type with him makes me happy <3

ESFP seems to be the general consensus
"I saw, and I agree :3"
"I think he's an ESFP. Th extrovert is a given, sensor because he loves thrills and things that appeal to the senses, F because he's very passionate, and P because he's free-spirited."
I agree with alot of your typings. Why do you think Skye is Ti though?
That works! :)
"ENFJs, ESFJs, ESFPs, ENFPs, INFPs, and ENTPs."
"Probably because I'm only a mild sensor, but I tend towards certain intuitive traits. Namely, idealism.  I'm also a bit more metaphorical than the typical ESFJ, or the typical sensor in general."
That was great! You sound dreamy :)
"I love everyone, but pretty much any of the introverted thinking types tend to rub me the wrong way."

"True. She just also seems pretty sensitive, so I'm not sure. I was kinda at a toss up for her."
"ENFPs are so full of life, cheer, and good humor! :)"
"ENFJ. I'm already very marginal on my S/N preference, so it probably wouldn't be a big change, but it'd be cool. E, F, and J are definitely here to stay!"
I'm an ESFJ conservative Republican.
I was just thinking this the other day. I have an ESFJ frenemy who's almost NOTHING like me! I only recently found out she was ESFJ and I was shocked!
Coulson- ESFJ May- ISTP or ISTJ Skye- ESFP Ward- INTJ Fitz- INXP Simmon- ISFP

"So the movie version of Felix is more introverted? Interesting. Or are you referring to the actor, since you used his real name?"
