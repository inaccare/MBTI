"Out of curiosity, in what format/presentation style do you propose other types ideas to be presented in? And does this format/style apply to the ENTJ's as well?"
I for one enjoy the varying ideas and viewpoints. I don't think anyone or type should be discouraged either through disclaimers or ridicule from posting in our forum. It seems as though we would be...

I think INTJs' more developed tertiary Fi works for them as a moral compass and an important decision making tool. It also can make them more artsy/sentimental (think INFPs and enneagram 4s).'
