My point in a nutshell. Thank you my friend.
Maybe an I?? He seems more I than E. That would make him an ISFJ I suppose.

I guess these are all the cool people on PerC :P It is bizarre how MBTI has so many people stereotyping. Maybe that's why many people who don't know much about it think it's so stupid?  I agree...

Yeah I really do get that impression. A lot of people in the ISFP forum don't really seem much like ISFPs...they're just artistic and therefore decide they're ISFP. I assume it's the same in a lot...
I'm just genuinely curious...why is there so much talk in typing with the stereotypes of N and S rather than what it actually is?   It's about how you take in information right?  So why all...

Thanks guys. I guess I have to resign myself to the fact that I don't fit it perfectly lol. But yeah.  ISFP is good. Just a lot of the really sensory stuff confuses me a bit. And the annoying...'

"My sister is an INFJ and I have called her harsh when she becomes systematical, analytical, logical like a Detective in an interrogation room when I am telling a story to people around her."
"People deny they are extroverted!? Why would they do that?In seriousness, I think its because they don't want to be percieved as emotional and unstable."
"I dont have a cell phone but I do use BlueStacks Android Player and use the Google voice app. I have days were I send 200 messages a day, and others with barely 2 messages."
"I haven't met many people who deny being extroverts,  but again most people are not aware of what being extroverted means."
I think it might be because we can come of as phony or alittle too friendly sometimes.
"Where its good news or bad, i am an ESFJ. At that time i took the questionnaire i didn't want to believe it, but after many cognitive function tests and my INTJ sister observations i am an ESFJ lol."

God no. I feel like I can pretend to be an insider but very few people know and accept the real me. It's a lonely feeling living in the past (Si) or being young with conservative values.
