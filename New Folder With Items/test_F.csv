How much bluntness or critism is part of your interactions with ESTJ? I'm trying to figure out if this ESTJ is trying to be helpful or just doesn't like me.
God no. I feel like I can pretend to be an insider but very few people know and accept the real me. It's a lonely feeling living in the past (Si) or being young with conservative values.
"My closest friends are INFP, INTP, INTJ. I love INXXs"
What type are you? INTJ?

I'm an ESFJ and can relate to 90% of this. You sound like an ESFJ who has well developed Se as well as Si.
