Hello there fellow ENFP! Welcome! :>
"I think I am, I just don't want to say I am and it turns out im not? :S"
"It sounds like he's been hurt a lot here but the chances are he does still have feelings for you he is just really hurt by what was said/done. I would just give him space honestly, he most likely..."
"Its what I've heard from the grapevine. I would also say I would be an example of such as I can just seem/feel quite shy and want to be on my own from time to time, yet I am definitely an extrovert...."
Yeah essentially! ENFPs tend to be the most 'Introverted of the Extroverts' so a lot of the time they tend to get mistaken to be INFPs a lot!
"Okay, going by that comment and the other comments on this thread, I think I'm going to have to also agree for the moment and type him as a ESFP!"
"This one is a bit of a shot in the dark, But can he sometimes seem a bit introverted at times? like will he take moments to have time by himself?"
"I mean, I tend to wear a lot of pastels (mainly pink and white) and girly cute things but I will wear different things but In my own style, Idk :S"
"I say sorry a lot, I even say sorry when I shouldn't. I suppose It has become a habit of mine 0.o"

Hi thanks for your insight. I decided INFP because I tend to be a homebody even in childhood. I suspected INFP at first but then when I learned ENFPs like the most alone time of the Extroverts I...

Thanks for your opinion but this is directed to those who came to the conclusion they are INFP and why they think they are.
"Yeah, in the back of my mind I know I shouldn't care about it. And the truth is when it comes down to it I resist being labeled so it's kind of strange but I'm enjoying it for the time being."

What does it mean when thinking is both so low? Is it supposed to line up with a certain pattern or is it common that not everyone is exactly in the typical order
