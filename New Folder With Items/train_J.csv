Surely she's an ENTJ? :o
Why? :)

"Some ISTJs are VERY direct, some are not.   Ask him straight out if he wants to break up.   99% he will answer this directly and honestly."
There is a difference in motivation.  An ISTJ will usually do things because he or she sees it as the right thing to do. Whether it pleases someone else isn't normally a factor.  An ISFJ is much...

Yep. The advice I would give here is the same as his last thread. http://personalitycafe.com/istj-forum-duty-fulfillers/823538-28-years-old-never-had-girlfriend-am-i-loser.html
"^^^ This was my first thought.  Also, are there careers performing studies and such where you could use your degree?"
Talk to him about it. Be honest and direct without being confrontational.
^^^ lol... the posts above.  I was married to an ENFP for 19 years.   We spent half of the time debating what she inferred from what I said.
I love to travel. It's one of the few ways I can let go.  I have been to all 50 US states and 30 something countries. In my youth I back-packed around Europe three times.
"Breaking stereotypes... why? I am me. I don't care if other ISTJs are like me, or different.  What if I told you I am Irish and I like to drink? oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo"
"Dude- you are living too much inside your own head. You need to do something outdoorsy... start hiking, camping, bike riding, something.....   BTW, stuff just hurts from time to time."
"Yep, and it's MUCH worse than being alone."
A few items; -Online dating works. Keep trying. Some have forums where you can post your profile and have users critique it. -Try to hang with women whenever possible. This increases your skills......
Be happy for him.  It could be worse. I got a motorcycle AND started jumping out of airplanes again.

"I am not sure I understand. Are you asking if we would see that we are being used? If that is the question, speaking just for myself... yes. I recently ended a relationship for that very reason."
You are who you are. She is what she is. The way you show love was not what she perceives as being love. Some people have needs that many ISTJs cannot give.   Look at it this way- if you are a...
We ISTJs do better in stressful situations when we know what is happening. You should have told him about the issues from your life changing situation so he understood why you got upset so easily. ...
"I am not sure what you mean by drama, but if an ISTJ sees you as an impediment to getting their work done properly, they will not just let things go."

First- don't assume. Ask him to take an MBTI test to KNOW if he is ISTJ or not.  Second- make your intentions clear. We tend to respect and respond to directness and clarity.
It's not that an ISTJ will hold back for the purpose of depriving an ENFP. It's that the ENFP needs more communication and on a different level than the ISTJ has to give.  Look at it this way- a...

Why do we complain about people generalizing?  Isn't MBTI all about generalizing?  Generalizing = Simplifying
Book smart = No people skills
I am ENTJ... and my fav was physics cause it's applied theory. I guess this has something to do with Te (Applying) and Ni (Theory).

Definitely not. I would never forget if I was romantically interested. Plans/scheduling is REALLY important to ESTJs.
Hell no. I think we're one of the most direct personality types. I find it really difficult to not voice how I feel. I also find it very difficult to omit/hide things.

I agree with alot of your typings. Why do you think Skye is Ti though?
That works! :)
"ENFJs, ESFJs, ESFPs, ENFPs, INFPs, and ENTPs."
