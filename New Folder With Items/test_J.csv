Hi I just want to ask if other INFJs have the guts to dominate or if no chance be submissive to others. In my case Im always on the submissive side as if I have no chance to control myself or others
Darnit baby! I want to show myself to others but cant. I want to show my talents. hahahaha. but too shy to do so. And Im so afraid of getting rejected..
"I dont know what to do. I feel incomplete, I dont feel emotionally connected and I always change every time and then. Im tired being surrounded by these people who dominates me and handling my life...."
Why are we so kind individual? I mean why do we always want to help? I think its because we want to be notice. I want to feel that I belong in this world too. Is that so wrong? Grrr.
"I would like to be alone than dealing with people who judge me easily. I enjoy being alone, like this surfing the net, being independent and not relying and bothering other people."
Hm. In my case I always feel like im inside the shell :((
Maybe they were just hurt for judging the child personality
I always daydreaming about me. I am a singer in a concert and the crowds are clapping and enjoying their time listening to my voice. They look like they are really having fun :))) ROFL
I always feel that I never did anything good. Darn.
Dont worry guys! Im here for you :)))))
Darn. Its the same with me. People dont really listen! Hate it!
Around people? You mean when we are not around of people we can be free? Or we dont let ourselves to get out of this box Im feeling. We cant be who really are because of people judging us.
Hey everyone! Have you felt that you are inside the box and hiding? I mean Im there and Im around people but why I feel so invisible as if no one really see me.

"Hehehe. I feel the same way. I dont talk to people I know well. I find them boring or even senseless to talk to. I want to be alone and do what keeps me happy. People will just leave, I think they..."
"Hm. Yeah. I think I change a lot. I dont know Its just Im being so nice and giving to people whom I really care, yet they dont know how to appreciate me."
I think you should leave the house. Hehehe. You dont need your family if they dont understand you or even listen to you. There are thousands of people and you are not alone. Just get a life you know....
You INFPs are always self pitying.
Yehey! You agree with me! Yes its nudity but not trying to seduce them.
Yeah I think they should not look.
What? You think its hot? My parents are telling me to put on clothes. But I really dislike it! Do you think its okay to walk around the house nude?

Woah ESTPs vulnerable? Really? You guys have a good body which I really admire. Maybe you are strong outside but vulnerable inside
Are you 594? hehehe. Im 459. Glad to meet you :))
Have you ever experience that people laugh at us so/sx's? uh. I hate it! Im walking doing my own thing and the people around are smiling and laughing.
yeah we should all be put to a fucking death I guess
I find myself talking differently. I mean how I pronounce them.
Why? Do you hate us that much?
Im so/sx. how do you guys see us? are we acting different?
a fucking senseless person.
I do the same thing. Im an escapist! and I really dont want to be on the spotlight.

This is interesting and something that has lead me to study MBTI and socionics more in depth. I tend to test as ESFP or ESFJ yet I favor Fe highly and use Si often. I dislike Se when I need to use...
"Spend as much time with others as possible, and essentially avoid being bored and alone for any stretch of time."
I agree with the second point made by Norina. It is a misconception that ESFJs are not aware of their feelings.  I am ALWAYS aware of how I feel about EVERYTHING. I just may not express it in most or...
I do agree we lack forward thinking and planning and agree with the videos on this point. My lack of Ni is my weakness (probably why being around INFJs makes me feel so inferior). There is a...

I agree with the two previous posters. As soon as I saw this post I thought I hate people. Lol.

How much bluntness or critism is part of your interactions with ESTJ? I'm trying to figure out if this ESTJ is trying to be helpful or just doesn't like me.
God no. I feel like I can pretend to be an insider but very few people know and accept the real me. It's a lonely feeling living in the past (Si) or being young with conservative values.
"My closest friends are INFP, INTP, INTJ. I love INXXs"
What type are you? INTJ?

I'm an ESFJ and can relate to 90% of this. You sound like an ESFJ who has well developed Se as well as Si.

Being alone mainly. I hate being stuck in on a Saturday or friday night with nobody to talk to or nowhere to go. It's the worst feeling to get.

Nope
